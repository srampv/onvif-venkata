# Java ONVIF (Open Network Video Interface Forum)

ONVIF is a community to standardize communication between IP-based security products (like cameras).

This project aims to improve https://github.com/milg0/onvif-java-lib.<br>
I've tried to convice its author to use to my code but it seems we have different objectives: my goal is to create a project that focus on the funny part of the development of an ONVIF application, **keeping the interaction with the WS as simple as possible** and delege that annoying part to Apache CXF in order to not waste the developer time in writing (and MAINTAINING) code that interacts with ONVIF web services.<br>
My wish is to help other developers willing to contribute to an enterprise-level Java library for ONVIF devices.

Apported improvements
=============
* Project **mavenization** and **modularization** (separation between Java stubs and application) and 
* WS client generation using Apache CXF maven plugin (declaring the specific Onvif specification of each wsdl)
* maintainability and extendability of the overall code
* Separation of Test/examples from other code

Rebuilding WS stubs
=============

If you need to change the list of managed WSDLs (in onvif/onvif-ws-client/src/main/resources/wsdl) and thus you need to regenerate the WS Java stubs using the [Apache CXF codegen maven plugin](http://cxf.apache.org/docs/maven-cxf-codegen-plugin-wsdl-to-java.html), you need to go through the following steps:
 1. **Download Onvif WSDLs** to onvif/onvif-ws-client/src/main/resources/wsdl appending the version before the .wsdl suffix.
 For example, from main dir (onvif) use you can run the following shell commmand:<br>
```wget http://www.onvif.org/onvif/ver10/device/wsdl/devicemgmt.wsdl onvif-ws-client/src/main/resources/wsdl/devicemgmt_2.5.wsdl ```
 1. **Update WSDLLocations constants (if needed)** within class  *de.onvif.utils.WSDLLocations* (module onvif-java)
 1. **Add required url-rewriting rules (if needed)** to onvif/onvif-ws-client/src/main/resources/wsdl/jax-ws-catalog.xml
 1. Delete old Java classes in onvif/onvif-ws-client/src/main/java
 1. **Run the class generation command**: decomment goal and phase of cxf-codegen-plugin in onvif-ws-client pom.xml and run ```mvn clean install```
 1. To see how to properly add a new ONVIF service to OnvifDevice look into OnvifDevice.init()

TODOS
=============
My next goals are:
 1. Create an active community of enthusiastic developers (the crazier you are, the better)
 1. Write a more comprehensive examples (e.g. subscribe to an event notification, use I/O ports, etc...)
 1. Create consistent Onvif specifications tags (at least for onvif-ws-client). For example: 2.4, 2.5, etc...
 1. Fix WS-Discovery example (with my camera it doesn't work at all)
 1. Write a simple UI to test the device functionalities
 1. Fix offline mode (xml files in *local* folder)
